        <span>I’m the sun, and you’re the moon,</span>
        <span>We’ve never met, but I think of you too soon.</span>
        <span>I wake up and feel you in the air,</span>
        <span>A quiet thought, as if you're always there.</span>
        <span>I glow a little brighter every day,</span>
        <span>Hoping somehow, you’ll find your way.</span>
        <span>You’re not here, but still, I smile,</span>
        <span>Like you're close, even if just for a while.</span>
        <span>I don’t know why, but my heart feels full,</span>
        <span>Like there’s a piece of you that fits me well.</span>
        <span>I catch myself wondering what it’d be,</span>
        <span>To share a laugh, to simply be.</span>
        <span>We’re like two stars in different skies,</span>
        <span>Shining brightly, but never quite in sight.</span>
        <span>I wait, and I wish, as days go by,</span>
        <span>For the chance to finally look you in the eye.</span>
        <span>But until then, I’ll keep dreaming,</span>
        <span>Of you and me, of something gleaming.</span>
        <span>Even if we never meet, you’ll always stay,</span>
        <span>A little thought that makes my day.</span>
