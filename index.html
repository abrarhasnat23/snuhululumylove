    <div class="poem">
      <p>I’m the sun, and you’re the moon.</p>
      <p>We’ve never met, but I think about you.</p>
      <p>I wake up every day, and for some reason,</p>
      <p>I feel like you’re out there, somewhere, maybe thinking of me too.</p>
      <p>I try to shine a little brighter, but I’m not sure why,</p>
      <p>Maybe hoping you’ll notice, maybe hoping you’ll find me.</p>
      <p>I smile even though you’re not here.</p>
      <p>It feels like you’re close, even though I know you’re not.</p>
      <p>I don’t really understand it, but something in my chest feels full,</p>
      <p>Like there’s a space inside me that only you could fit into.</p>
      <p>I find myself imagining what it would be like—</p>
      <p>To sit with you, to laugh, to just be.</p>
      <p>We’re like two stars in different parts of the sky,</p>
      <p>Shining, but never in the same place.</p>
      <p>I wait, and I wish, and I wonder if you’re out there too.</p>
      <p>Maybe one day, we’ll finally meet and it’ll feel like home.</p>
      <p>But until then, I’ll hold on to this thought,</p>
      <p>That even if we never cross paths, I’ll still carry you with me.</p>
      <p>You’re the quiet thought that gets me through the day.</p>
      <p>Even if you’re not here, you’re still somehow with me.</p>
