            <p class="line">I’m the sun, and you’re the moon.</p>
            <p class="line">We’ve never met, but I think of you too soon.</p>
            <p class="line">I wake up and feel you in the air,</p>
            <p class="line">A quiet thought, as if you're always there.</p>
            <p class="line">I glow a little brighter every day,</p>
            <p class="line">Hoping somehow, you’ll find your way.</p>
            <p class="line">You’re not here, but still, I smile,</p>
            <p class="line">Like you're close, even if just for a while.</p>
            <p class="line">I don’t know why, but my heart feels full,</p>
            <p class="line">Like there’s a piece of you that fits me well.</p>
            <p class="line">I catch myself wondering what it’d be,</p>
            <p class="line">To share a laugh, to simply be.</p>
            <p class="line">We’re like two stars in different skies,</p>
            <p class="line">Shining brightly, but never quite in sight.</p>
            <p class="line">I wait, and I wish, as days go by,</p>
            <p class="line">For the chance to finally look you in the eye.</p>
            <p class="line">But until then, I’ll keep dreaming,</p>
            <p class="line">Of you and me, of something gleaming.</p>
            <p class="line">Even if we never meet, you’ll always stay,</p>
            <p class="line">A little thought that makes my day.</p>
